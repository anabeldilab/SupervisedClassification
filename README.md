# Máster Universitario en Informática Industrial y Robótica Project Outline
# Subjects: Machine learning and Artificial Vision I
## Escuela Politécnica de Ingeniería de Ferrol - Academic Year 2023/2024

### Objective
Develop machine learning models for supervised classification of a real dataset using Python and its ecosystem (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, keras, etc.).

### Dataset Selection
- Recommended to choose from datasets on Kaggle, AIcrowd, or UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- Students with "Artificial Vision I" background must select an image dataset.

### Proposal Submission
- Communicate the chosen project theme by February 23, 2024.
- Email a brief document describing the dataset, its location (URL), and objectives for approval.

### Project Requirements
- Study and analyze preprocessing techniques.
- Use at least four machine learning techniques, including one deep network in Keras.
- For "Artificial Vision I", apply feature extraction including CNNs with transfer learning or fine-tuning.
- Perform cross-validation and report using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, and AUC.
- Add boxplots that include the results of the different cross-validation runs.

### Comparative Performance Study
- Carry out an analysis of the performance obtained by each of the models.
- Conduct a study based on model hyperparameters (if it is neural networks, change the number of neurons and layers).
- Design Python code to run all experiments in a single run, saving results to a spreadsheet.

### Statistical Analysis
- Use hypothesis testing to determine statistically significant performance differences between models.

### Support
- Seek advice and schedule tutorials with the professor.

### Documentation
- Submit source code files in Python with comments.
- Provide a detailed project report in Word or PDF.
- Prepare a 20-minute oral presentation in PowerPoint or PDF.

### Important Dates and Information
- Projects can be individual or in pairs.
- Counts for 50% of the final grade.
- Presentations scheduled outside class hours.
- Deadline: March 24, 2024, at 23:59h.
